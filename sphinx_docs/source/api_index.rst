pyMultiFit API
==============

The Application Programming Interface (API) of `pyMultiFit` provides tools for statistical data generation and model fitting, organized into three primary layers:

* **Distributions**: Statistical distributions for data modeling, generation, and fitting.
* **Fitters**: Classes implementing fitting algorithms for statistical models.
* **Generators**: Functions for generating synthetic datasets.
