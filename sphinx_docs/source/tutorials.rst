The ``pyMultiFit`` library is divided into three modules,

1. **distributions**, housing statistical (and non-statistical) distributions, such as ``GaussianDistribution``, ``LaplaceDistribution``, and more.
2. **generators**, can generate single or n-model data based on the selected distribution. And finally
3. **fitters**, that can fit n-model data on the given data.asdf
