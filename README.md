## What is `pymultifit`

`pymultifit` is a library made specifically to tackle one problem, **fit the data with multiple fitters**.

Fitter implementations include,

- `Gaussian` fitter,
- `SkewedNormal` fitter,
- `LogNormal` fitter, and
- `Laplace` fitter, and more.

Additionally, it provides capabilities to generated n-modal data as well through its `generators` module.
Along with this, the user can also generate probability distribution data using `distributions` module.

## How to install

Using pip: `pip install pymultifit`
